# LaxarJS Patterns [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LaxarJS/laxar-patterns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LaxarJS/laxar-patterns)

> Utilities to implement standard event patterns in LaxarJS widgets

The LaxarJS Runtime already defines the semantics of [core event patterns](//github.com/LaxarJS/laxar/tree/master/docs/manuals/events.md#core-patterns).
For application-level events, _LaxarJS Patterns_ provides an additional vocabulary, which may be grouped into a handful of _pattern families_.
Also, a helper library is provided, to simplify dealing with event subscriptions.

Have a look at the [docs](docs/index.md) for more information, but  make sure that you are familiar with [LaxarJS](//github.com/LaxarJS/laxar) first.

For efficient usage of the available pattern libraries in your widgets, you should consult the [API docs](docs/api) as well.
