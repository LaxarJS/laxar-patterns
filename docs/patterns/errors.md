# Error Handling Patterns

Any LaxarJS widget or activity that communicates with the outside world can experience an error condition.
This can be a an HTTP server that is not reachable anymore, failing to open a WebSocket connection, or an unexpected privilege restriction imposed by the web browser.

### The _didEncounterError_ Event

Widgets may use the `didEncounterError` event to inform about problems from which they cannot recover.
This allows for some other dedicated widget or activity to take an appropriate measure, for example by displaying a message to the user or by informing a REST service dedicated to monitoring or logging.
No topic configuration is needed for this event, as it is assumed that only a small number of activities or widgets are responsible for handling all types of errors.

The `didEncounterError` event is _not_ intended to handle programming errors, such as null-pointer errors, which should be eliminated during testing.
Also, it is not intended to inform about invalid user input: 
Have a look at [resource validation events](./resources.md#validation) instead.

Event name                         | Payload Attribute  | Type    | Description
-----------------------------------|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------
`didEncounterError.{code}`         |                    |         | _published by any widget to indicate an unrecoverable error_
                                   | `code`             | string  | `HTTP_GET` or `HTTP_PUT` (if applicable)
                                   | `message`          | string  | a more precise description of the problem
                                   | `data`             | object  | additional details, specific to the problem

The `code` values stand representative for any _read_ and _write_, or _(I/O)_ problems.
If necessary, a sub-topic can be added, for example `HTTP_PUT-WEB_SOCKET`.

The `message` and `data` attributes should contain additional information.
